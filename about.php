			<p><i>Consolidated Electric Power Asia Limited, (“CEPA”) has extensive experience in the operation and maintenance of power plants. Building upon Managements’ long history of constructing and operating coal fired power plants prior to the turn of the century, however in the early 2000’s management made a decision to switch to gas fired power as well as sustainable, renewable energy. Today, associated CEPA Group companies operate a 315 MW CCGT gas fired power plant in Sengkang Indonesia and will take over operation and maintenance of a new 650 MW CCGT power plant in Pagbilao, the Philippines upon completion of construction, as well as O&M for the adjacent Pagbilao LNG Hub Terminal. In addition, CEPA will be the O&M operator of a 2 MTPA LNG Liquefaction plant currently under construction in Sengkang Indonesia.</i></p>

<p><i>In addition to the aforementioned facilities awaiting construction completion and formal handover, CEPA has partnered with Energy World International who has nominated CEPA to be the exclusive O&M provider for the Philippines’ Kanan River Renewable wind and hydro power projects and Louisiana’s 5 MTPA Fourchon LNG liquefaction facility which are both currently in the design and permitting phase. Once in operation, Management will have realized its long term strategic goal to transition away from conventional coal fired power and into sustainable renewable energy which will preserve and protect the environment while providing economical power urgently needed in developing countries.</i>
